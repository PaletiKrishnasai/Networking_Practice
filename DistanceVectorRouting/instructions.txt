Instructions :

run on different terminals ( if the code gets buggy, close the terminal and re run it again )
Usage: ./a.out <neighborFile> <vectorFile> <nodeNumber> <Port#> <#Of nodes>

Reffered medium articles and used portions of existing online code snippets.
socket connection fails sometimes due to OS issues.

Utilizing the Distance Vector Algorithm to find the most cost-efficient path between multiple nodes. Ability to view 
that node's neighbors, update the cost to travel to its neighbors.

 --->   Options
 - print- Print Current Node's DV Table
 - refresh - Send Current Node's DV Table of Neighbors
 - update - Update Current Node's DV table
 - route - Display's the lowest cost route to desired node and which node to hop to
